Project Overview
----------------

In this project...

TODO

To test it, [Term 2 Simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases) need to be used. The latest version of `main.cpp` used to run this project without the simulator can be found [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Extended-Kalman-Filter-Project/blob/06cbc9967bc62592723eef99b8c8035e4a22ea7b/src/main.cpp).

If you are looking for Udacity's started code project, you can find it [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Project).

Installation
------------

This repository includes two files that can be used to set up and intall [uWebSocketIO](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets):

- `install-mac.sh` for Mac.
- `install-ubuntu`for either Linux or [Windows 10 Bash on Ubuntu](https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/) (**please, make sure it is updated**).

For Windows, Docker or VMware coulso also be used as explained in the [course lectures](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/16cf4a78-4fc7-49e1-8621-3450ca938b77). Details about enviroment setup can also be found there.

If you install from source, checkout to commit `e94b6e1`, as some function signatures have changed in `v0.14.x`:

    git clone https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets
    cd uWebSockets
    git checkout e94b6e1

See [this PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Project/pull/3) for more details.

**Regarding `Ipopt` and `CppAD`**, please refer to [this document](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Project/blob/master/install_Ipopt_CppAD.md) for installation instructions.


Build & Run
-----------

Once the install is complete, the main program can be built and run by doing the following from the project top directory:

1. Create a build directory and navigate to it: `mkdir build && cd build`
2. Compile the project: `cmake .. && make`
3. Run it: `./MPC`

Or, all together (from inside the `build` directory): `clear && cmake .. && make && ./MPC`

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d).


## Tips

1. It's recommended to test the MPC on basic examples to see if your implementation behaves as desired. One possible example
is the vehicle starting offset of a straight line (reference). If the MPC implementation is correct, after some number of timesteps
(not too many) it should find and track the reference line.
2. The `lake_track_waypoints.csv` file has the waypoints of the lake track. You could use this to fit polynomials and points and see of how well your model tracks curve. NOTE: This file might be not completely in sync with the simulator so your solution should NOT depend on it.
3. For visualization this C++ [matplotlib wrapper](https://github.com/lava/matplotlib-cpp) could be helpful.)
4.  Tips for setting up your environment are available [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)
5. **VM Latency:** Some students have reported differences in behavior using VM's ostensibly a result of latency.  Please let us know if issues arise as a result of a VM environment.

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/b1ff3be0-c904-438e-aad3-2b5379f0e0c3/concepts/1a2255a0-e23c-44cf-8d41-39b8a3c8264a)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./

# Websocket Data

This document describes the JSON object send back from the simulator command server.

Fields:

* `ptsx` (Array<float>) - The global x positions of the waypoints.
* `ptsy` (Array<float>) - The global y positions of the waypoints. This corresponds to the z coordinate in Unity
since y is the up-down direction.
* `psi` (float) - The orientation of the vehicle in **radians** converted from the Unity format to the standard format expected in most mathemetical functions (more details below).
* `psi_unity` (float) - The orientation of the vehicle in **radians**. This is an orientation commonly used in [navigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_coordinate_system#Position_and_navigation).
* `x` (float) - The global x position of the vehicle.
* `y` (float) - The global y position of the vehicle.
* `steering_angle` (float) - The current steering angle in **radians**.
* `throttle` (float) - The current throttle value [-1, 1].
* `speed` (float) - The current velocity in **mph**.


### `psi` and `psi_unity` representations

`psi`

```
//            90
//
//  180                   0/360
//
//            270
```


`psi_unity`

```
//            0/360
//
//  270                   90
//
//            180
```
